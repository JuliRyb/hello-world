		<h3>Recipe:</h3>
		<ul>
			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<li>Milk</li>
			<li>Yeast</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Butter</li>
			<li>Sugar</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Flour</li>
			<li>Oil for frying</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>Preparation</h3>
		<p>Step 1<br><span>Heat the milk until it is warm but not hot, about 90 degrees. In a large bowl, combine it with
				the
				yeast.
				Stir lightly, and let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.</span></p>
		<p>Step 2 <br><span>Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, beat the eggs, butter,
				sugar and salt into the yeast mixture. Add half of the flour (2 cups plus 2 tablespoons), and mix until
				combined, then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add more
				flour, about 2 tablespoons at a time, if the dough is too wet. If you’re using an electric mixer, the dough
				will probably become too thick to beat; when it does, transfer it to a floured surface, and gently knead it
				until smooth. Grease a large bowl with a little oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl, and cover. Let rise at
				room temperature until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.</span></p>
		<p>Step 3 <br><span>Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and roll it to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out the
				doughnuts with a doughnut cutter, concentric cookie cutters or a drinking glass and a shot glass (the larger
				one should be about 3 inches in diameter), flouring the cutters as you go. Reserve the doughnut holes. If
				you’re making filled doughnuts, don’t cut out the middle. Knead any scraps together, being careful not to
				overwork, and let rest for a few minutes before repeating the process.</span></p>
		<p>Step 4 <br><span>Put the doughnuts on two floured baking sheets so that there is plenty of room between each
				one. Cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place until they are slightly puffed up and
				delicate, about 45 minutes. If your kitchen isn’t warm, heat the oven to 200 at the beginning of this step,
				then turn off the heat, put the baking sheets in the oven and leave the door ajar.</span></p>
		<p>Step 5 <br><span>About 15 minutes before the doughnuts are done rising, put the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or
				Dutch oven over medium heat, and heat it to 375. Meanwhile, line cooling racks, baking sheets or plates with
				paper towels.</span></p>
		<p>Step 6 <br><span>Carefully add the doughnuts to the oil, a few at a time. If they’re too delicate to pick up
				with your fingers (they may be this way only if you rose them in the oven), use a metal spatula to pick them
				up and slide them into the oil. It’s O.K. if they deflate a bit; they’ll puff back up as they fry. When the
				bottoms are deep golden, after 45 seconds to a minute, use a slotted spoon to flip; cook until they’re deep
				golden all over. Doughnut holes cook faster. Transfer the doughnuts to the prepared plates or racks, and
				repeat with the rest of the dough, adjusting the heat as needed to keep the oil at 375. Glaze or fill as
				follows, and serve as soon as possible.</span></p>
		<h3>Well done!</h3>
